# Contributing to the genealogy client

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The project uses [git flow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) for versioning 
and uses [psr-2 code guidelines](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)

```
composer install --dev
```

Make sure there is no output in the following commands after changes

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit ./tests
./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=psr2 ./src
./vendor/bin/phpmd ./src/ text ./vendor/phpmd/phpmd/src/main/resources/rulesets/cleancode.xml
```

There is also a check.sh script which runs all of the above commands

```
chmod 755 check.sh
./check.sh
```
